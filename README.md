# Face-Mask-Detection-using-CNN
## Overview
This project focuses on developing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to detect whether a person is wearing a face mask or not. The model has been trained and tested using the Face Mask Dataset available on Kaggle.
## Features
- Detection of face masks in images.
- High accuracy and real-time performance.
- Easy to use and integrate with other applications.
## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Face Mask Detection dataset from Kaggle. It consists of images labeled as "with_mask" and "without_mask". The dataset can be found https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/omkargurav/face-mask-dataset.
## Model Architecture
The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) used in this project has been designed to efficiently extract features from images and classify them into the respective categories (with_mask and without_mask).
## Results
The model has achieved an accuracy of 91.% on the test set. Detailed training logs and model performance metrics can be found in the results/ directory.
